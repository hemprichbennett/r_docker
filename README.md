# r_docker
this container uses R 3.5. This is so that it runs easily on a rasberry pi: raspberry pi 4s can run 64-bit OSs, but currently there is only one available, and it isn't raspbian. Modify the dockerfile to add a repository for a newer version of R if required, as some R packages require newer versions
Experimenting with installing R and several packages in a dockerfile, this is a simple repository for sandboxing rather than anything serious
